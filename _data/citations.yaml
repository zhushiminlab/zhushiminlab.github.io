      <li>自控力越低，越容易遊戲成癮。在此項研究中，絕大多數（44/46篇）數據支持了這一點。</li>
      <li>幫助年輕人學會自我調節，可以減少沉迷遊戲。</li>
      <li>自控力低與遊戲成癮的現象，在18歲以下以及18-25歲的人身上很相似，意味著干預措施將對大多數年輕人都有用。</li>
      <li>來自亞洲（如中國、韓國）的研究最多，可能是這些地區更重視自律和遊戲成癮問題。</li>
      <li>Poor self-control = higher risk of gaming addiction — 44 out of 46 studies agree.</li>
      <li>Teaching self-management skills could help reduce gaming addiction in youth.</li>
      <li>Teens (&lt;18) and young adults (18-25) show similar risks, so prevention strategies can cover both groups.</li>
      <li>Most studies are from Asia (e.g., China, Korea) — where self-discipline is valued and gaming addiction is a big concern.</li>

      <li>以下學生改善幅度最大：原本焦慮程度較高、情緒觀較固定、希望能夠改善現狀。
      <li>實用建議：這些簡短的網上心理健康工具可在學校內輕鬆實施，尤其適合對較少主動求助的學生進行早期支援。</li>
      <li>All four web-based 45-minute sessions reduced anxiety and depression in secondary students, with effects lasting at least 8 weeks.</li>
      <li>No one method outperformed others, but all were low-cost, scalable, and well-received (over 60% found them helpful and acceptable).</li>
      <li>Best results were seen in students with:higher anxiety, fixed mindset, motivation to improve.
      <li>Practical use: These brief, online tools can support student mental health early. They are easy to deliver in school and useful for those reluctant to seek help.</li>

    <li>青少年視角｜接觸數字心理健康干預的促進和障礙</li>
    <li>數字心理健康干預的接受程度主要取決於質量和效果。</li>
    <li>研究從外部環境（如能否融入學校體系、社會是否普遍認可）、干預服務（如設計是否符合需求、使用時間是否靈活）、個體因素（如是否覺需要幫助、是否擔心隱私洩露）三個層面共識別14項促進因子與13項障礙因子。</li>
    <li>提升青少年接受度的實踐建議：
    <ul>
    <li>以用戶為中心：設計工具時要真正理解並滿足青少年的需求；</li>
    <li>混合服務模式：將數字干預工具和傳統的面對面心理服務結合起來；</li>
    <li>靈活個性化選項：讓用戶可以根據自己的喜好和情況調整工具的使用方式。</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The acceptance of digital mental health interventions primarily depends on their quality and effect.</li>
    <li>In terms of acceptability, we have identified 14 facilitators and 13 barriers across three levels: the external environment (e.g., whether the intervention can be integrated into the school system, or whether it is socially accepted), the intervention itself (e.g., whether the design meets user needs, or whether it allows flexible usage), and individual factors (e.g., whether the individual perceives a need for help, or whether there are concerns about privacy breaches).</li>
    <li>Practical recommendations for enhancing adolescent acceptance:
      <ul>
      <li>User-centred: Interventions should be designed with a deep understanding of and responsiveness to adolescents’ needs;</li>
      <li>Blended service model: Combine digital intervention tools with traditional face-to-face mental health services;</li>
      <li>Offer flexible and personalised options: Allow users to tailor how they engage with the intervention based on their preferences and circumstances.</li>

      <li>自我控制信念是可改變的這一理念，可透過校園教育或輔導活動進行強化，作為預防或干預遊戲成癮的切入點。</li>
      <li>Students’ beliefs about self-control influence their gaming behaviour. Those who believe that self-control cannot change are more likely to develop more severe gaming addiction symptoms after one year.</li>
      <li>Girls with a growth mindset—believing that self-control can be improved—show a clear reduction in gaming addiction symptoms; for boys, gaming addiction tends to weaken their belief in self-control.</li>
      <li>The idea that self-control beliefs can be changed can be reinforced through school-based education or counselling activities, serving as an entry point for preventing or intervening in gaming addiction.</li>

      <li>使用將個體間和個體內的方差分離的分析方法，結果顯示自我控制與遊戲障礙之間沒有因果性關係，即自我控制既不是兒童和青少年遊戲障礙的原因，也不是他們遊戲障礙的結果。</li>
      <li>我們推測一些因素構成低自我控制和遊戲障礙的共同潛在原因。首先，個人特徵（包括與這些特徵相關的性格特徵和遺傳因素）可能是共同原因。其次，長期的個人內部和環境因素可能解釋目前發現的自我控制與遊戲障礙之間穩定的個體間關聯。</li>
      <li>單純改善自我控制的干預措施可能無法阻止或預防青少年遊戲障礙的發展，其他共同因素或共病情況值得注意。</li>
      <li>Using analysis which disaggregated the between-person and within-person variances, this study revealed no prospective relationship between self-control and gaming disorder, indicating that self-control was neither the cause nor the result of gaming disorder in children and adolescents.</li>
      <li>There are some speculations about what may serve as the common underlying cause of low self-control and gaming disorder. First, personal characteristics, such as personality traits and genetics linked to these traits, may serve as common causes. Second, chronic intrapersonal and environmental factors may account for the currently identified stable between-person associations between self-control and gaming disorder.</li>
      <li>Interventions to improve self-control alone might not stop or prevent the development of gaming disorder among youths. Other common factors or comorbidities are worth noting.</li>

      <li>Not all gaming motivations are harmful—some (like improving skills or daily relaxation) may even be beneficial.</li>
      <li>When games are used to escape reality or when preoccupation dominates, the risk of disorder increases.</li>
      <li>For adolescents with worsening gaming issues, simply limiting screen time may not help. It's more effective to address why they play and support healthier alternatives (e.g., helping them find real-life goals or confidence).</li>
      <li>Encouraging healthy gaming motivations is important, such as learning strategies or teamwork through games, rather than letting gaming become an escape from emotional or academic challenges.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>疫情停課期間，超過八成香港青少年有打機行為；其中約兩成過度打機，5% 有成癮傾向。</li>
      <li>孤獨感會影響打機行為，尤其是高年級的女生，這部分可能與焦慮與抑鬱有關。</li>
      <li>家長支持與監督可減少打機問題，特別對小學生效果明顯。</li>
      <li>預防建議包括：減少學生孤獨感、關注心理健康，以及鼓勵家長參與。</li>
      <li>During school closures, over 80% of Hong Kong youth played games; about 1 in 5 played excessively, and 1 in 20 showed signs of gaming addiction.</li>
      <li>Loneliness was linked to problematic gaming, especially among older girls—but this link was partly explained by anxiety and depression.</li>
      <li>Parental support and supervision reduced gaming problems, particularly for primary school students.</li>
      <li>Prevention should focus on reducing loneliness, supporting mental health, and encouraging parent involvement.</li>
    </ul>
