    本研究系統性回顧與整合了遊戲成癮與自我控制之間的關係。結果顯示，兩者之間存在中等強度的負相關，尤其在青少年與新興成年人中皆有穩定結果。強化自我調節能力可能有助於減少遊戲成癮風險，相關研究多來自中國、韓國等亞洲國家，反映了文化對自律的重視及對遊戲成癮的關注。
    <br>
    This systematic review and meta-analysis explores the link between problematic gaming and self-control. Results show a medium-strength negative correlation across studies, especially in adolescents and emerging adults. Enhancing self-regulation may help reduce gaming addiction risk. Most studies were conducted in East Asia, reflecting cultural concerns about self-discipline and gaming behavior.

    1.數字心理健康干預（DMHIs）的接受度受質量與效果主導，高質效促進使用，低質效則成障礙。
    <br>     
    2.外部（如與學校整合、社會規範）、干預（如設計相關性、靈活時長）、個體（如需求感知、隱私擔憂）三層面共識別14項促進因素與13項障礙。
    <br> 
    3.非便攜設備中質效最關鍵；便攜設備中設計和諧與內容參與度同樣重要；多平台需平衡風險感知與用戶體驗。
    <br> 
    4.實踐建議: 用戶中心設計、混合服務模式（結合傳統與數字干預）、靈活個性化選項可提升青少年對DMHIs的接受度。
    <br> 
    1.‘Quality and effect’ is central — superior quality and effect enhances the adoption of DMHIs, while inferior quality and effect constitutes a critical barrier.
    <br> 
    2.At the external (e.g., school integration, social norms), intervention (e.g., design relevancy, appropriate duration), and individual (e.g., perceived need, privacy concerns) levels, a total of 14 facilitators and 13 barriers were identified.
    <br>  
    3.Non-portable devices prioritise quality and effect; portable devices emphasise design harmony and content engagement; multi-platform interventions require balancing risk perception with user experience.
    <br> 
    4.Recommendations: Promote user-centred design, hybrid models (integrating digital and traditional care), and flexible personalisation to optimise the uptake of DMHIs.

    1.我們的研究發現相信自我控制能否改變與遊戲障礙症狀嚴重程度之間存在雙向關係。
    <br>     
    2.對男孩和女孩參與者的分組分析顯示，在女孩中，關於自我控制的更多成長型心態預測了較輕的遊戲障礙症狀，而在男孩中則沒有這種關係。同時，較嚴重的遊戲障礙症狀預測了一年後男孩和女孩關於自我控制更加固定的心態。
    <br> 
    3.我們的結果表明遊戲障礙對個人自我控制可塑性信念有負面影響，並暗示促進關於自我控制的成長型心態可能是預防和早期干預遊戲障礙的有前景策略，尤其是對女孩而言。
    <br> 
    4.實踐建議: 用戶中心設計、混合服務模式（結合傳統與數字干預）、靈活個性化選項可提升青少年對DMHIs的接受度。
    <br> 
    1.A bidirectional relationship was found between self-control mindsets and gaming disorder symptom severity.
    <br> 
    2.Subgroup analyses of boy and girl participants revealed that more growth mindsets regarding self-control predicted less severe gaming disorder symptoms in girls but not in boys, while more severe gaming disorder symptoms predicted a more fixed mindset of self-control in both boys and girls after 1 year.
    <br>  
    3.Our findings demonstrated the negative impact of gaming disorder on one’s self-control malleability beliefs and implied that promoting a growth mindset regarding self-control might be a promising strategy for gaming disorder prevention and early intervention, especially for girls.

    1.使用將個體間和個體內方差分離的分析方法，結果顯示自我控制與遊戲障礙之間沒有因果性關係，即自我控制既不是兒童和青少年遊戲障礙的原因，也不是他們遊戲障礙的結果。
    <br>     
    2.我們推測一些因素構成低自我控制和遊戲障礙的共同潛在原因：首先，個人特徵（包括與這些特徵相關的性格特質和遺傳因素）可能是共同原因。其次，長期的個人內部和環境因素可能解釋目前發現的自我控制與遊戲障礙之間穩定的個體間關聯
    <br> 
    3.單純改善自我控制的干預措施可能無法阻止或預防青少年遊戲障礙的發展，其他共同因素或共病情況值得注意。
    <br> 
    4.實踐建議: 用戶中心設計、混合服務模式（結合傳統與數字干預）、靈活個性化選項可提升青少年對DMHIs的接受度。
    <br> 
    1.Using analysis which disaggregated the between-person and within-person variances, this study revealed no prospective relationship between self-control and gaming disorder, indicating that self-control was neither the cause nor the result of gaming disorder in children and adolescents.
    <br> 
    2.There are some speculations about what may serve as the common underlying cause of low self-control and gaming disorder. First, personal characteristics, such as personality traits and genetics linked to these traits, may serve as common causes. Second, chronic intrapersonal and environmental factors may account for the currently identified stable between-person associations between self-control and gaming disorder.
    <br>  
    3.Interventions to improve self-control alone might not stop or prevent the development of gaming disorder among youths. Other common factors or comorbidities are worth noting.

    1.並非所有遊戲動機都是「有害的」，部分動機（例如：提升能力、日常放鬆）對青少年来說是有益的。
    <br>  
    2.當遊戲成為逃避現實或過度沉迷的出口時，更容易引發網絡遊戲障礙。
    <br>  
    3.對於遊戲行為逐漸惡化的青少年，單純限制遊戲時間未必有效。更重要的是了解其背後的遊戲動機，並協助他們在現實生活中建立成就感與自信心。
    <br>  
    4.引導青少年發展正向的遊戲動機很重要，例如透過遊戲學習策略思維、團隊合作與解難能力，而不是單純沉迷於虛擬世界來逃避情緒或學業壓力。
    <br>  
    1.Not all gaming motivations are harmful—some (like improving skills or daily relaxation) may even be beneficial.
    <br>  
    2.When games are used to escape reality or when preoccupation dominates, the risk of disorder increases.
    <br>  
    3.For adolescents with worsening gaming issues, simply limiting screen time may not help. It's more effective to address why they play and support healthier alternatives (e.g., helping them find real-life goals or confidence).
    <br>
    4.Encouraging healthy gaming motivations is important, such as learning strategies or teamwork through games, rather than letting gaming become an escape from emotional or academic challenges.
